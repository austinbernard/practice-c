**Dartmouth IMT-C.01**

### Lesson 1.1 Objectives

	[] modify the 'hello world' program to create a C-program that prints text and special characters to the screen
	[] create C-programs that utilize one or more for loops to repeat one or more printing instructions a defined number of times
	[] explain C-code by adding comments
	[] use comments in three different ways:
        	[] at the end of (but on the same line as) an instruction
        	[] on one line by itself
        	[] over multiple lines
	[]recognize and label the preprocessor directives, the main program, the variable declaration section and the statement section of the main function of a simple C-program

### Lesson 1.2 Objectives
	[] use the format specifier %d in printf statements to print integers and results of integer operations
	[] explain the concept of a variable
	[] distinguish between declaring a variable and assigning a value to a variable
	[] declare a variable of type integer
 	[] assign a value to a variable of type integer
	[] re-assign a value to an integer-type variable
	[] update the value of an integer-type variable based on its previous value
	[] use variables inside loops to modify an instruction based on the value of the variable
	[] read one or more integer inputs from the user using scanf()
	[] process user integer input to determine looping behavior of a program


#### [140 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/19/19]
- Making comments in C ( // )
- Comments after end of instruction
- Comments inside comments to debug by disabling parts 
- You work in the C-programming censorship office and your job is to ensure that programs written by developers comply with certain rules. 
	The two censorship rules are as follows:
	- Programs cannot use for-loops with more than 10 repetitions.
	- Programs are not allowed to say 'goodbye!'.
- Single / multiple line commits
- Preprocessor directive 
- Main function
- Variable declaration
- Executable statements
- Return statement
- Use format specifier %d to print integer value within printf (function)
- Perform simple integer arithmetic with format specifier
- Create variable (declaration) and initialize (assignment, definition, initialization) variables in the form of integers in one instruction
- Syntax rules for declaring/naming a variable(s)
- Printed a multiplication table in C & Python programming language
- Reading single integers using scanf() statement
- Reading multiple integers using scanf() statement

#### [ 30 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/20/19 ]
- Using scanf() inside a loop to read multiple user inputs

#### [ 45 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/20/19 ]
- Process user integer input to determine looping behavior of a program *WALL* -I will try again in the morning

#### [ 45 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/21/19 ]
- Worked on problem set (:
  
#### [ 40 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/21/19 ]
- Finished problem set, debugged problem and bypassed WALL onto next adventure!!
- Use the format specifier %d in printf statements to print integers and results of integer operations
- Explain the concept of a variable
- Distinguish between declaring a variable and assigning a value to a variable
- Declare a variable of type integer
- Assign a value to a variable of type integer
- Re-assign a value to an integer-type variable
- Update the value of an integer-type variable based on the value of the variable
- Read one or more integer inputs from the user using scanf
- Process user integer input to determine looping behavior of a program

### Lesson 1.3 Objectives
	[] distinguish between and give examples of integer, double and character data
	[] declare a variable of type char
	[] declare a variable of type double
	[] assign a character to a variable of type char
	[] assign a decimal to a variable of type double
	[] use the format specifier %c to read character using scanf and print characters using printf
	[] use the format specifier %lf to read decimals using scanf
	[] use the format specifier %lf with modifiers to print decimals to a given precision
	[] predict results of integer division in C
	[] explain the importance of conversion between integer and double data types
	[] use casting to convert between integer and double data types
	[] create C-programs that perform tasks involving user input, integer and floating point arithmetic operations and output to the screen

#### [ 90 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/22/19 ]
- Declare, assign, and print characters with %c format specifier
- Prompt user to know what to input correctly
- Declare, assign, and print decimal numbers with type double (%lf)
- Read decimal numbers from user input with scanf()
- Read ints and doubles with scanf()

#### [ 45 minute sprint Compiling Code Implementation - 11/23/19 ]
- Researched C automation for reading files and writing files in excel
- Found out that Python was a better solution

#### [ 45 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/24/19 ]
- Worked on problem set 1.3
- Differentiating between using format specifiers (%d and %lf)
- Posed a question in stackoverflow (found the answer in the suggested box)
- Divide in C
- Stack: Why does scanf() need “%lf” for doubles, when printf() is okay with just “%f”?
	- [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/210590/why-does-scanf-need-lf-for-doubles-when-printf-is-okay-with-just-f)

#### [ 45 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/24/19 ]
- Find the remainder in integer division
- Convert int to doubles

#### [ 140 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/25/19 ]
- Completed 1.3_1 problem set
- Convert doubles to integers
- Completed 1.3_2 problem set
- Debugged Following Bugs:
	- error: expected ‘=’, ‘,’, ‘;’, ‘asm’ or ‘__attribute__’ before ‘expected’
	- error: ‘percentGrowth’ undeclared (first use in this function)
	- error: conflicting types for ‘expected’
- Corrected main error by assigning a double value to a variable of type int

#### [ 40 minute sprint - 11/25/19 ]
