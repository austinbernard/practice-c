## To Fight Imposter Syndrome - My Daily Sprint Trackers

**Dartmouth IMT-C.01**

#### Lesson 1.1 Objective
<<<<<<< HEAD
-[ ] create C-programs that utilize one or more for loops to repeat one or more printing instructions a defined number of times
-[ ] explain C-code by adding comments
-[ ] use comments in three different ways:
-[ ] at the end of (but on the same line as) an instruction
       - [ ]on one line by itself
       - [ ]over multiple lines
-[ ]recognize and label the preprocessor directives, the main program, the variable declaration section and the statement section of the main function of a simple C-program

### [45 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/19/19]
-Repeat an instruction with a for loop
-Repeat multiple instructions with for loop
-Repeat a block of instructions with a for loop
-Common Looping Errors
-Fixing Bracketed Errors

### [140 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/19/19]
-Making comments in C ( // )
-Comments after end of instruction
-Comments inside comments to debug by disabling parts ( /*   */ )
-You work in the C-programming censorship office and your job is to ensure that programs written by developers comply with certain rules. The two censorship rules are as follows:
	-Programs cannot use for-loops with more than 10 repetitions.
	-Programs are not allowed to say 'goodbye!'.
-Single / multiple line commits
-Preprocessor directive 
-Main function
-Variable declaration
-Executable statements
-Return statement
-Use format specifier %d to print integer value within printf (function)
-Perform simple integer arithmetic with format specifier
-Create variable (declaration) and initialize (assignment, definition, initialization) variables in the form of integers in one instruction
-Syntax rules for declaring/naming a variable(s)
-Printed a multiplication table in C & Python programming language
-Reading single integers using scanf() statement
-Reading multiple integers using scanf() statement

### [ 30 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/20/19 ]
-Using scanf() inside a loop to read multiple user inputs

### [ 45 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/20/19 ]
-Process user integer input to determine looping behavior of a program *WALL* -I will try again in the morning

### [ 45 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/21/19 ]
-Worked on problem set (:
  
### [ 40 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/21/19 ]
-Finished problem set, debugged problem and bypassed WALL onto next adventure!!
-Use the format specifier %d in printf statements to print integers and results of integer operations
-Explain the concept of a variable
-Distinguish between declaring a variable and assigning a value to a variable
-Declare a variable of type integer
-Assign a value to a variable of type integer
-Re-assign a value to an integer-type variable
-Update the value of an integer-type variable based on the value of the variable
-Read one or more integer inputs from the user using scanf
-Process user integer input to determine looping behavior of a program

#### Lesson 1.3 Objectives
	[] distinguish between and give examples of integer, double and character data
	[] declare a variable of type char
	[] declare a variable of type double
	[] assign a character to a variable of type char
	[] assign a decimal to a variable of type double
	[] use the format specifier %c to read character using scanf and print characters using printf
	[] use the format specifier %lf to read decimals using scanf
	[] use the format specifier %lf with modifiers to print decimals to a given precision
	[] predict results of integer division in C
	[] explain the importance of conversion between integer and double data types
	[] use casting to convert between integer and double data types
	[] create C-programs that perform tasks involving user input, integer and floating point arithmetic operations and output to the screen

[ 90 minute sprint Dartmouth Edx - 11/22/19 ]
-Declare, assign, and print characters with %c format specifier
-Prompt user to know what to input correctly
-Declare, assign, and print decimal numbers with type double (%lf)
-Read decimal numbers from user input with scanf()
-Read ints and doubles with scanf()
